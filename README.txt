How to execute:
1) This program is written in the Python language. The first step to execute this program is to run the ppalms.py file.
This can be done by opening a terminal and typing: python3 ppalms.py. If you do not have Python installed, you can download 
the latest version of Python for your operating system through this link: https://www.python.org/downloads/

2) After running the program, you will be prompted with some questions. First, enter the text file name with the source code.
This should already exist in your folder. The next few questions will be about edits to make to the source code. Do you want to 
remove comments, exclude lines, or group lines together? The updated source code according to your answers will be displayed on the terminal.
Along the way, the terminal will also display any errors that occur due to your answers (entering in incorrect bounds, for example).
